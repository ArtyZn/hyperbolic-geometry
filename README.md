# Hyperbolic Snake game

Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry with parallel postulate replaced by 
`For any given line R and point P not on R, in the plane containing both line R and point P there are at least two distinct lines through P that do not intersect R.`
and with constant negative Gaussian curvature.

In my project I use hyperboloid model to store coordinates and rotation matrices and Poincaré disk to display data on screen. I picked those because it's really easy to turn spherical geometry into hyperboloid model just by slightly changing rotation matrices, and Poincaré disk being the easiest to understand and draw geodesics on.
